## Introduction
Getso Command is a cutting-edge pose command recognition system leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning. By extracting key body points, it creates a dynamic, interactive user experience, pushing the boundaries of human-computer interaction.

## Architecture and Key Features Technology

### 1. Frame Capture Optimization
- **Efficient Threading**: Uses threading and queue system for high-performance frame capturing.
- **Flexibility with Input**: Supports direct processing of video files through file address input.
- **Enhanced Real-time Processing**: Optimizes real-time video frame handling for smoother performance.

### 2. Person Detection with YOLOv8
- **Rapid and Accurate**: YOLOv8 is known for its speed and precision in detecting persons.
- **High-Resolution Capability**: Excellently handles high-resolution inputs for detailed detection.
- **Simultaneous Detections**: Capable of detecting multiple people in a single frame.

### 3. Pose Detection with MediaPipe ([LearnOpenCV Analysis](https://learnopencv.com/yolov7-pose-vs-mediapipe-in-human-pose-estimation/))
Getso Command employs MediaPipe for its pose estimation capabilities due to several advantages over other technologies like YOLOv7:

- **Superior on Low-Res Inputs**: Outperforms YOLO in low-resolution settings.
- **CPU-Optimized Performance**: Faster performance on CPU, ideal for non-GPU devices.
- **Distant Object Detection**: Effective in detecting distant persons.
- **Single-Person Focus**: Specialized in single-person detection, aligning with application goals.
- **Reduced Computational Load**: Lower resource requirement compared to YOLOv.

### 4. Neural Network Architecture
- **Advanced Pose Recognition**: Employs a sophisticated neural network for interpreting gesture sequences.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses 1D Convolution and Time Distributed layers for effective feature analysis.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Incorporates Bidirectional GRUs for capturing dynamics over time.
- **Gesture Classification**: Ends with a softmax layer for precise gesture categorization.

### 5. Continuous Gesture Recognition
- **Dynamic Keypoint Updating**: To maintain an ongoing recognition process, the model processes sequences of 30 keypoints obtained from 30 frames (representing 1 second) to predict gestures accurately.
- **Real-Time Responsiveness**: The application ensures real-time responsiveness by dynamically updating the keypoints sequence. With each new frame captured, the oldest keypoint in the sequence is removed, and the newest keypoint is appended. This method guarantees that the model always analyzes the most current data, ensuring fluid and continuous gesture recognition.
- **Balanced Processing**: Efficiently manages the addition of new data and removal of older data, maintaining a balance that is crucial for continuous and accurate gesture interpretation.
- **Versatile Command Set**: Recognizes commands such as 'Hello', 'Alarm', and 'Play Music', with all other gestures marked as 'Unknown'.


## Installation
Follow these steps to set up Getso Command on your system:

1. **Download the Pretrained Model Weights**:
   - First, download the [pretrained model weight](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZrOyA84jIop2Z1WJGwOauCKoBzELfOgu/view?usp=sharing).
   - Place the downloaded file into the ***models*** directory within your Getso Command project folder. Note that due to Github limitations, you will need to create the ***models directory*** yourself.

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the root directory of the Getso Command project.
   - Run the following commands to install necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Getso Command responds to the following gestures:

- **Hello**: Initiate with a right-hand wave.
- **Alarm**: Activate by raising both hands.
- **Play Music**: Trigger by performing the predefined dance movements.

```bash
python run.py -f ./video.mp4 -r [192, 1, 1015, 747]
```

or

```bash
python run.py -f rtsp://username:password@ip:port
```
